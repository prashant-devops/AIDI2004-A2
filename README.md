# Breast Cancer Classification using Gradient Boosting

This code demonstrates how to train a machine learning model to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Gradient Boosting Classifier algorithm.

## Instructions

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
2. Run the code by executing the Python script in your preferred Python environment.

## Dataset

The code uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset available at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)).

The dataset contains various features computed from digitized images of breast mass, and the target variable represents the diagnosis (malignant or benign) of the breast cancer tumor.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: the proportion of correctly classified samples.
- Precision: the ability of the model to correctly predict positive samples.
- Recall: the ability of the model to correctly identify positive samples.
- F1-Score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
